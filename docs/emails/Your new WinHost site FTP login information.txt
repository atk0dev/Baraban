Dear Andrey Tkach,

Your new site, elendress.com, is now provisioned. 

You may log in to Control Panel (https://cp.WinHost.com/) to get information regarding email account set up and much more. 

If you wish to upload files before your domain name registration is active or your name server updates propagate, you can use the Secondary FTP login. FTP login information is located in the "Site Info" section of Control Panel. 

Your FTP username and password are:

Username:	elendres
Password:	[Your Control Panel password]
