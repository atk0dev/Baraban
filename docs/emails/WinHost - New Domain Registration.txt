Dear Andrey Tkach,

Your new domain, elendress.com, has been registered.

Domain management is handled through Control Panel (https://cp.WinHost.com/), simply click the "Domains" tab to access all of your WinHost domains. 

You may use this domain for a new site, as a domain pointer on an existing site, or just leave it "parked" until you decide what you would like to do with it.

Thank you for using WinHost!
